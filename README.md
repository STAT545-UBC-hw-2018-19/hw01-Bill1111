## Introduction
My name is William Hall, and I am a PhD student in Health Economics in the faculty of Medicine at UBC. Don't know what Health Economics is? Nobody does. Here is [what we do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics) in a nutshell. I also work at the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Evaluation which is a research centre at Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. You can check out my bio here - (https://www.c2e2.ca/william-hall).

My classmates have been helping me out a lot online and in class when I have questions. I really appreciate it :smile:
