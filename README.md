# Homework Assignment 1 - William Hall

## Overview
In this README file, I have included the following:
1. An introduction for myself
2. A description of the repository
3. My Reflections on the Assignment

## Introduction
My name is William Hall, and I am a PhD student in Health Economics in the faculty of Medicine at UBC. Don't know what Health Economics is? Nobody does. Here is [what we do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics) in a nutshell. I also work at the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Evaluation which is a research centre at Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. You can check out my bio here - https://www.c2e2.ca/william-hall.

How did I feel about learning R and GitHub when I signed up for this class? Something like this:

How do I feel when I can't easily move a file into a folder on my repository? This:

My classmates have been helping me out a lot online and in class when I have questions. I really appreciate it :smile:

## Repository Description
This repository is one of the first ones I have created. The goal is to fulfill all the requirements for [STAT 545 Assignment 1](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/assignments/hw01/hw01.md).

The ~~repotisory~~ repository contains:
1. This README.md File
2. A gapminder dataset exploration in with R Markdown, saved in both:
      1. .RMd and
      2. .md files

## Reflections

The learning curve was pretty sharp in the first few weeks here being a first timer to the GIT, and being a novice at R - but I managed to get through this first assignment. As I posted in the internal chat, I think some screen recordings of how to do different actions in Git Hub would be very helpful to us noobs.

For the README.md, I just edited in github.com. I'm still a little lost with all the cloning, branching, and pushing. I created the R markdown file in R on my computer, then just saved it on my desktop, then uploaded the files into my homework repository.

I think that the most fun I had was adding the gifs to this README.md file, and doing cool stuff in R with R Markdown. There are a lot of resources for R online which is really nice. I've included some of the resources I found helpful below:
